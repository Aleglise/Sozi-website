Zooming in or out
-----------------

The field ``Zoom (%)`` allows to set a zoom effect during
a transition. Fill this field with:

- a positive value to zoom in,
- a negative value to zoom out,
- zero if no zoom effect must be applied.

The value of this field is relative to the zoom
level of the source or target frame of the transition.
This is illustrated by the following diagrams:
